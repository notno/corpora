# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a fantasy vocabulary extraction pipeline in four phases. Phase 1 establishes document parsing (PDF/EPUB). Phase 2 builds the core value: Claude API classification of extracted terms. Phase 3 handles output generation, consolidation, and IP review (legally critical before shipping). Phase 4 adds batch processing for production-scale use.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Document Parsing

**Goal**: Users can extract clean, normalized text from PDF and EPUB documents
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PARSE-01, PARSE-02, PARSE-03, PARSE-04, PARSE-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can run CLI command on a PDF file and receive extracted text output
  2. User can run CLI command on an EPUB file and receive extracted text output
  3. Scanned PDFs automatically fall back to OCR when native text extraction fails
  4. Extracted text is normalized to consistent format regardless of source format
  5. Font encoding issues produce warnings but do not crash processing
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Project setup, Pydantic models, and utility modules
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - PDF and EPUB parser implementation
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md - OCR integration and CLI implementation

### Phase 2: Vocabulary Extraction & Classification

**Goal**: Users can extract fantasy-relevant terms from text and receive richly classified vocabulary
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: EXTRACT-01, EXTRACT-02, EXTRACT-03, CLASS-01, CLASS-02, CLASS-03, CLASS-04, CLASS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can extract candidate vocabulary from parsed document text
  2. Extracted terms include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and multi-word expressions
  3. Each term is classified with full schema (id, text, genre, intent, pos, axes, tags, category, canonical, mood, energy, source)
  4. Classification output validates against Pydantic schema without errors
  5. API rate limits are respected without manual intervention (automatic backoff)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md - NLP extraction with spaCy (models, extractor, filters)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md - Claude API classification (client, batch, prompts)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md - CLI integration (extract command, preview, progress)

### Phase 3: Output & IP Review

**Goal**: Users can generate per-document JSON, consolidate into master vocabulary, and review IP-flagged terms
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: OUTPUT-01, OUTPUT-02, OUTPUT-03, OUTPUT-04, IP-01, IP-02, IP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can generate one JSON file per processed source document
  2. User can consolidate multiple per-document JSONs into a single master vocabulary
  3. Duplicate entries are merged with variants linked to canonical forms
  4. Incremental updates add new documents without reprocessing existing ones
  5. Terms potentially IP-encumbered are flagged for human review
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md - Output foundation (models, vocab writer)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md - IP foundation (blocklist, detector)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md - Consolidation core (manifest, merger, consolidator)
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md - Review queue and CLI integration

### Phase 4: Batch Processing

**Goal**: Users can process entire folders of documents with progress tracking and fault tolerance
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: BATCH-01, BATCH-02, BATCH-03, BATCH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can point CLI at a folder and process all supported documents
  2. Progress display shows documents completed vs remaining
  3. Interrupted processing can resume from where it stopped
  4. Multiple documents can process in parallel for faster throughput
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Batch processor core (models, parallel executor, retry)
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - CLI integration with progress display and tests

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Claude API over local LLM for rich classification on CPU-only machine
- Per-document JSON then consolidate for incremental processing
- Separate IP review step for human oversight
- src-layout package structure for clean imports
- Pydantic v2 with model_dump_json for serialization
- PyMuPDF for PDF extraction with OCR integration
- spaCy en_core_web_sm for fast NLP extraction
- Claude Haiku 4.5 for cost-efficient classification
- Batch API for 50% cost savings
- ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel document processing

**Issues Resolved:**
- Model ID fix: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 → claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
- Markdown code block stripping for API responses
- custom_id 64-char limit for Anthropic Batch API

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
